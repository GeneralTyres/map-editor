    <p><strong>Atenika</strong> aims to create a visual representation of history. We make sure that all our references are publicly
    available online so that it can be accessed by anyone. So in a sense this is representation of the information
    accessible to everyone and what we can create together through things like YouTube and Wikipedia.</p>
